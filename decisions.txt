decide whether to save which agent belongs to which player in Game or Board -> Board will just have public information, the Game (meaning class
HeimlichAndCo will save which agent belongs to which player)

How do you encode the fields? each field could be 0-10 and -3 these could be field IDs but this would be kind of hard to model then the field position. Positive would be that
each field has the information about the points received "built into it". With the other approach (each field gets a number from 0-11) so indexing could be done with modulo 12 calculation
it will be easier to calculate the resulting fields after movement, but one would need an extra function to get the points per field. I chose the second option.

use "defensive" approach for board?? throw exceptions or just do it???


Challenges:
- make it impossible for agents to cheat
     + player agents never receive access to the Board, they only get a copy of it
- String representation of Board
