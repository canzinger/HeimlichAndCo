# Cards

In general, there are 3 different types of cards:

- HeimlichAndCoAddScorePointsCard
- HeimlichAndCoMoveSafeCard
- HeimlichAndCoMoveAgentsCard

## 1. HeimlichAndCoAddScorePointsCard

- Number of different types: 1
- This card allows the player to move the score markers (i.e. increase the score) of
  two agents by three fields each, but only up to the field (=score) of 40.

## 2. HeimlichAndCoMoveSafeCard

- Number of different types: 1
- This card allows the player to move the safe to a building of their choice. This
  will not trigger a scoring round.

## 3. HeimlichAndCoMoveAgentsCard

- Number of different types: 12
- The different cards of this type allow the player to move agents in different ways.
  Each type will therefore be described here separately.
  Mind that the numbering of the types
  here is the same as for the "type" variable in the card itself.
